## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Platform:** iOS
* **Development Environment:** Xcode
* **Programming Language:** Swift / SwiftUI
    * *(Based on the provided code snippets and the screenshot showing `ProfileView`, this project uses SwiftUI for UI development.)*
* **Backend & Services:**
    * **Firebase (Google Cloud Platform):**
        * **Firestore:** NoSQL database for storing user profiles, pantry items, meal logs, favorite recipes, and generated meal plans.
        * **Firebase Authentication:** For anonymous user authentication.
    * **Google Gemini API:** The core AI model for generating personalized recipes and meal plans.
    * **External Libraries/SDKs:**
        * Firebase iOS SDK (for Auth, Firestore) - typically integrated via Swift Package Manager or CocoaPods.
        * GoogleGenerativeAI (for Gemini API integration) - usually integrated via Swift Package Manager.
        * Charts Library (e.g., `Charts` or `SwiftCharts` if a native charting library is used, as the provided React code's `Chart.js` is web-specific).
            * *(**Self-correction:** Since the original provided code was React, if you've re-implemented charting natively in Xcode, you'll need a suitable iOS charting library. If you haven't, you might omit this or mention it as a future feature.)*
